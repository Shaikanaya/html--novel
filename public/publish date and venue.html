<h4>Where will be the ceremony?</h4>
<ul>
    <li>As it was my first novel, I'm thinking it to arrange at special place.</li>
    <li>I have a thought about beach.</li>
    <li>The place should be quite and surrounded with greenary.</li>
    <li>Like a park if there is no beach loacated near to me.</li>
</ul>
